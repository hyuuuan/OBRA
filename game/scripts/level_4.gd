## LEVEL 4 -- DILIM. The dark forest on Mt. Makiling, crossed alone.
##
## Extended BY PATH rather than by `class_name LevelBase`, for the reason every level is: a
## `--script` run does not register class names and the probes are exactly that.
##
## What this level is, in the machine's terms (LEVEL_4.md has the design and why):
##
##   * NO COMPANION. Lolo stopped at the water, so `_has_companion()` is false and every note the
##     level says -- the rescues, the tool notes -- is in the apo's own voice. The opening still
##     plays: it is hers now (dialogue_l4.json).
##   * A LEVEL THAT FIGHTS, built from hooks LevelBase keeps off everywhere else: the lantern as
##     her health, the dark, weapons that wear out, every drawing costing ink. Each is switched on
##     below by itself, so a probe can name the one it is about.
##   * ROUTES ARE CHOSEN BY WHAT SHE DOES. There is no dialogue node and no choice popup: the
##     drawing, or the deed, is the answer, and the level gives the ending one point -- its
##     majority route (`"tally": "majority"` in level_04.json).
